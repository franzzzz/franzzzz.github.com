exceed

	: to be greater or more than (something) : to be better than (something)
	: to go beyond the limit of (something)

2. It is possible that fees paid by movie studios for screenplays will decrease in the future relative to those for book rights.

这是可能的（费用（电影制作公司付给（AX--）->（BX++）））

3. The argument fails to rule out the possibility that a writer engage in both types of writing as well as other types.

rule out
