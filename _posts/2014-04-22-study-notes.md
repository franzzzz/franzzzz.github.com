#Argumment

##argument 分析论证句式

5. The argument simply equates success with movie ticket sales, which is unwarranted.

unwarrantable

    :  not justifiable : inexcusable

equate

    1 a : to make equal : equalize 
       b : to make such an allowance or correction in as will reduce to a common standard or obtain a correct result
    2 : to treat, represent, or regard as equal, equivalent, or comparable <equates disagreement with disloyalty>

文章简单的将（影票销售）与（成功）相等同，这是不公正的。

6. The author assumes that physical capabilities are the only attributes necessary to operate a motor vehicle.

作者假设（生理能力）是 （骑摩托） 唯一重要的因素。

7. Moreover, the author provides no evidence that the realism of color photography is the reason for its predominance.

predominance

    : the state of being more powerful or important than other people or things
    : a situation in which there is a greater number or amount of a particular type of person or thing than of other people or things

而且，作者没有提供任何证据表明（彩摄的现实主义风格）是（获得主导地位）的原因。

8. This assumption presents a false dilemma, since the two media are not necessarily mutually exclusive alternatives.

alternative

    : offering or expressing a choice
    : not usual or traditional

necessarily

    : used to say that something is necessary and cannot be changed or avoided

这个假设代表了一种误区，因为（两种（媒体）并不肯定是互斥的两种选择）。

9. Common sense tells us that a photograoher can succeed by working in both media.

常识告诉我们：（摄影工作者能在两种媒体下游刃有余）

10. The argument ignores the factors - such as initiative, creativity, technical skills, and business judgment - that may be more important than the choice of medium in determining success in photograohy.

initiative

    :  of or relating to initiation :  introductory, preliminary
        主动地 自发的 主动权

文章忽视了一些因素（（比如积极性，创造性，科技，商业决断），这些（在决定成功方面）可能具有比（媒介选择）更重要）。

11. __The major problem with the argument is that___ the stated simlarities between Company A and B __are insuffcient to support the conclusion that__ Company A will suffer a fate simliar to Company B.

文章的主要问题是（（（CA）和（CB）的相似性）并不能充分支持这个结论（CA会面临和CB相似的命运）。

12. __Consequently, the mere fact that__ `Company A` holds a large share of the video-game hardware and software market __does not support the claim that__ `Company A` will also fail.

mere

    :used to say that something or someone is small, unimportant, etc.
    :used to say that something small is important or has a big effect or influence

因此，这一事实是（CA占有XX和XX市场）并不能支撑结论（CA会倒闭）。

13. __Thus, the author unfairly assumes that__ `highly-rated public television programs` are necessarily widely viewed, or popular.

`(Thus n.乳香。。。)`

因此，作者不偏激的假设（（高评分电视节目）肯定有（高收视率或受欢迎））。

14. __While this may be true in some cases, it is equally possible that__ only `companies with products that are already best-sellers` can afford the higher ad rates that popular shows demand.

虽然在很多案例中这可能成真，但是同样可能（只有那些（产品热卖的）公司才能负担起热门节目的高广告率）

15. __Admittedly,__ `the vice president's reasoning linking employee benefits with company profits` __seems reasonable on the surface__.

reasoning

    : the process of thinking about something in a logical way in order to form a conclusion or judgment
    : the ability of the mind to think and understand things in a logical way

不可否认的是， （总理的思路将A和B连接在一起）在表面上看来是有道理的。

16. __One can infer from__ the survey's results __that__ a full one-third of the respondents may have viewed the current benefits package unfavorably.

respondent

    : a person who gives a response or answer to a question that is asked especially as part of a survey

unfavorably

    : likely to cause problems or difficulties
    : expressing disapproval

package

    : a box or large envelope that is sent or delivered usually through the mail or by another delivery service
    : a wrapper or container that covers or holds something
    : something that comes in a container

从调查结果中能推断出（整整三分之一的反馈民众并不看好当前福利`政策?`）
